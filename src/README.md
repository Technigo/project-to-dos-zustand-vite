# Todo - useContext Project

This is a single-page application (SPA) featuring a simple and user-friendly tool for creating and managing a list of tasks, which can be marked as completed or removed.

This week's project has provided an excellent opportunity to practice and implement Global State Management with React Context.

### The Problem
