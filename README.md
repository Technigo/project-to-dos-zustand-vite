# Create a Todo app âœ…

This week's assignment involved building a fully functional Todo app using Zustand for state management and TypeScript to ensure type safety and scalability. The app allows users to manage tasks efficiently, adhering to best practices in responsiveness, accessibility and clean code.

### The Problem

The challenge was to implement a Todo app that meets the following requirements:

- List all tasks (completed and uncompleted).
- Mark tasks as completed or revert them back to uncompleted.
- Add and remove tasks dynamically.
- Display task counts (all tasks or uncompleted tasks).
- Ensure responsiveness across devices (320px to 1600px).
- Follow accessibility guidelines (e.g., alt attributes, proper color contrast).
