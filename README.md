# Todo - useContext Project
This week's project involves building a comprehensive todo application using React's Context API for state management, featuring task management, dark mode toggling, and responsive design.

### The Problem
Approaching the problem involved breaking it down into smaller tasks, starting with designing the application's components and state management using React's Context API. I planned by outlining the core features of the todo app, such as adding, completing, and removing tasks, as well as implementing dark mode functionality and ensuring responsiveness across different devices. Given the limited time available, I focused on implementing essential features, intending to refine the CSS styling and potentially add more advanced functionalities if time allowed.
