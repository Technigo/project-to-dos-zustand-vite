# Todo - useContext Project

The task was to create a todo list app implementing the React hook useContext.

### The Problem

We started out by laying out the design and structure of the components in FigJam, including which components would need which functions passed to them from the context. We looked at resources from both Technigo and others in order to figure out how to build the app.

If we had more time we would have tried out more of the stretch goals, like a time stamp.
