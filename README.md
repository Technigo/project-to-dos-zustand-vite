# Todo - useContext Project

A simple todo list to add your daily task. Make your life easier. 

### The Problem

It took me while to understand this project when I just started. However, it became easy to follow the global state with React context after this project. 

I practiced style form, and learned how to style checkbox. It was fun and I am happy to see the result.

I used ChatGPT a lot when I got stuck, but I realized that if you only use ChatGPT it actually not good, because it gives you very limit information. It is better to search materials such as by Google and YouTube.
