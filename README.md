# Todo - useContext Project

This week we learned about global state management and using Zustand to store information.

## Getting Started with the Project

I started with planning for my to do list. I wanted to have a post it like to do list. At first I did the same layout for desktop, tablet and mobile with a grid of cards but changed the mobile version to flexbox and slimmer, wider cards stacking on each other.

### The Problem

I had difficulties understanding what to put in the store and which functions to add but I looked a lot at Matildas live sessions and tried to follow that together with help from chatGPT. I also looked a lot at the happy thoughts project to get some inspiration and used some functions and conditionals from there. I found out after asking chat GPT about storage, that Zustand had a built in storage function called persist similar to locale.storage, so I used that.

If I had more time I would go for another layout on mobile but I like the color switch and line trough that I have when a task is completed and that works best when having separate task boxes.
