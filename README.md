# Todo - useContext Project

The assignment was to create a Todo app using React useContext for state management.

### The Problem

I started by creating the components then adding all the requested features gradually, like recommended in the instructions. Then I chose a color palette from Coolors which I matched with a background image from Unsplash. If I had more time I would of course have liked to do the stretch goals.
