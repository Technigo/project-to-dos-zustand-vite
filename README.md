# Todo - useContext Project

Todo App
This Todo app is built using React and Zustand for state management. It features a responsive design with a mobile-first approach, and provides users with an interactive and organized task list.

Key Technologies & Libraries:
React: Used for building the user interface with reusable components.
Zustand: A lightweight state management library for managing tasks globally.
Tailwind CSS: For styling and responsive design.
React Hooks: Utilized useState, useEffect, and custom hooks to manage state and side effects in the application.
Features:
Add, complete, and delete tasks.
Displays total, completed, and uncompleted tasks with dynamic updates.
Mobile-first design with responsive layout adjustments for tablets and laptops.
This app showcases my skills in state management with Zustand, React hooks, and responsive design principles.
