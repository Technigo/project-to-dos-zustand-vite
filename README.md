# Taskly â€“ A todo app by Helene Westrin

## The Project

For this project I decided I wanted to try to use [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) to experience what it is like to use a UI library built by someone else. Since they are using Tailwind so am I in this project.

I started with setting up the basic Zustands store with tasks and a function to add and delete tasks. After I had gotten that to work I wanted to expand my app. I wanted to add the possibility to add different lists. That's when I decided to try their Sidebar component for for the layout and a nice way to access the lists.

Here it got a little bit more complicated cause I needed to really get familiar with the Sidebar code in order to remove what I didn't need and also to add my lists and all the functionality I had built. It was a lot of back and forth, and quite a few bugs to fix, but I think I finally got it to work the way I wanted to.

If I would have had more time I would have broken out more stuff in to separate components.
