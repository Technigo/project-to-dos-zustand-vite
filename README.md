# The Project
This week's project we've built a to-do app using Zustand for Global State Management.

### The Problem
At first I found it hard to understand all the logical parts with Zustand. I started out with planning the structure and deciding what kind of components I needed. I also sketched out my ideas on a piece of paper and wanted to have a playful design. I found a Lottie animation I wanted to import which I managed to do with some help from google. I tried to reasearch a lot before starting with the code but I had to turn to chatgbt a bit to help me make it work. After I've made it work I moved onto styling the app. This week I also started with mobile first which helped me a lot when making the app responsive.
