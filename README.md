When each task is completed, just click on the check box under the parents approval. If its not done or not correctly done, unclick and the task is shown as pending again. 

When the task is approved (one or all of them)  by click on the checkbox, the teenager will get a reward for each task satisfactorily achieved. 

This total credits will be exchanged for extra benefits (previously agreed like: 1 reward = 1 hour video games; 2 rewards = 1 extra hour on friends meeting; 3 rewards = 10 $ extra to your week pocket money, etc.
