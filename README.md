# Getting Started with the Project

## The Problem

We started with a brainstorming session about how to structure the project and how we want the project to look since we didn't have any design to follow.

Then we started coding and implementing the basic requirements and some basic styling.
We ended up also adding some strech goals. We switched up the styling quite a few times.

If we would have more time we would implement a due date for the tasks and make use of the localstorage so taks would be stored if a user returns.
