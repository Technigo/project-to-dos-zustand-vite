# The Project
This week's project was to add typescript to a project we've already created. I chose this project, the to-do app.

### The Problem
I was a bit confused towards the end when merging and creating a new pull request. I've been working on a new branch where I added typescript. I merged the branch with the main after all changes were made and I couldn't create a new pull request and got lots of errors on netlify. After some trial and error I managed to do a new pull request on the new branch but my old pull request seem to be updated with the recent changes including typescript too (due to the merge I'm guessing). I felt like maybe I got a bit confused there. I solved the problem but the original pull request is now updated as well. Didn't dare to reset the main one in case something would go wrong.
